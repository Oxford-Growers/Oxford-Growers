title: Initial Meeting 2024
---
When: 27th Janurary 10am - noon.
Where: Thomas' House (*Ask Thomas if you don't know where this is).

The inaugural session of this year to get to know each other and kick things off.

It will be at Thomas' house, in the back garden (please message me if you don't know where this is).

I will elaborate a bit on the idea, we will do a round of introductions and work out where we want to do next.

# Accessibility
Making events accessible is important. Below is all the information about the event. If you have an access need that you aren't sure is met, please reach out and we can work out what accommodations are possible.

## Details
The event will be two hours long, but you are welcome to come and go when you want. I will ensure there is water and glasses, as well as tea and coffee. If you require any other refreshments, you are welcome to bring them.

## COVID
The event will be taking place outdoors, no further precautions are being taken.

## Wheelchair Access
There are two ~1" bumps between the front garden gate and the patio where I expect we will be standing. There is a ~1" bump into the room with the toilet, and then a narrow corridor to the toilet, which in turn is quite small. If you need more information please let me know and I can take pictures and we can see if things can be improved.
