title: Oxford Growers
---
Oxford Growers exists to connect people to make gardening and growing more social and to help the local community and ecosystem thrive.

Oxford Growers is a radical organisation based on the principle of mutual aid and prefigurative political action. It will connect groups of people to help each garden and grow through. People will offer knowledge, labour, access to land or cups of tea. We will make better use of our land for the community and ecosystem. In doing so we will raise our abilities to look after each other outside the destructive systems of capitalism.
