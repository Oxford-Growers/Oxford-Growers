## Details
The event will be two hours long, but you are welcome to come and go when you want. Thomas will ensure there is water and glasses, as well as tea and coffee. If you require any other refreshments, you are welcome to bring them. There will be limited seating ona a wooden bench and a couple of camping chairs. There will be a toilet avaliable.

## COVID
The event will be taking place outdoors, no further precautions are being taken.

## Wheelchair Access
There are two ~1" bumps between the front garden gate and the patio where we will gather. There is a ~1" bump into the room with the toilet, and then a narrow corridor to the toilet, which in turn is quite small. If you need more information please let me know and I can take pictures and we can see if things can be improved.
